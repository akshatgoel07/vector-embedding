
# Vector Embeddings

A simple tool to visualize text embeddings and explore semantic relationships between documents.

## What it does

- Converts text documents into vector embeddings
- Visualizes semantic relationships in 2D space
- Shows how similar texts cluster together
- Handles document chunking for longer texts
